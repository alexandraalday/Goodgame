# PROJECT: GOODGAME
**LIVE SITE:** 

**SUMMARY:** Goodgame is an app that lets you catalog your video games into gamelists like "currently playing", "wishlist", and "played". A little like Goodreads or Spotify, but for video games. 

# APPROACH
**TECHNOLOGY USED:** HTML/EJS, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery/, MongoDB/Mongoose, Node.js, Express

**DESCRIPTION:** 
- Goodgame is a full-stack, sessions based, three model CRUD app build with MVC file organization
  - Models: User (full CRUD), Gamelist (full CRUD), game
- User Stories:
  - All users can view games and user profiles 
  - Only registered and logged in users can create/edit/delete gamelists and edit/delete user accounts
  - App is sessions based so that users can only edit/delete playlists that they've made and only edit/delete their own account
 - Design:
   - HTML/CSS done with Bootstrap frameworks 
   - App is responsive

# ETC.
**PLANNED FEATURES:** 
- Giving users ability to rate game titles they have played.
- Game show pages would show the average rating from site users. 
- Hoping to pull from Giant Bomb Api so users can search for each game and click a button to add to their gamelists. No more manual entry of games.
